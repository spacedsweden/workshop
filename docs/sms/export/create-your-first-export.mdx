## Create your first Export and download the results

In this guide you will learn how to create an excel export containing all SMS messages between for a date range.

```shell
curl post https://data.sms.api.sinch.com/v1alpha1/exports/jobs \
  -d "{ \
    "exportType":""SMSMessages.daily.itemized", \
    "deliveryFormat": "Excel", \
    "parameters": "{intervalStart:2020-01-01, intervalEnd:2020-01-30}" \
    "webhookUrl": "https://webhook.site/d612e497-3efc-4769-a596-2bdab9b7c11b"
  }"
  -u client_id:client_secret
```

This will return a [job](#job) with status running and when the job completes, we won'tify on the webhookUrl

#### Get a webhook request

Once the job finishes, post the results to your webhookURL with the results of the job.

<OpenApiExample
  definitionId="export"
  pointer="#/components/examples/hookSample"
  hideSamples={false}
/>

Use the URL in the results object with your API credentials to download the file.

```shell
curl get https://data.sinch.com/v1/exports/files/dimnn3ijivne5354353454.xlsx
  -u client_id:client_secret

```
