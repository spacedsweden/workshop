# Export Data API

To support your reconciliation workflows, you can use the long-running export API. The API notifies you via a webhook when the job is done. The data is available for 7 days for you to download.

The exports are generated with each day’s data defined by activity between 12:00 AM UTC and 11:59 PM UTC.

## Use cases

- Compare internal traffic reports with sinch records.
- Work with your data in Excel
- Import data to Tableau for aggregation and visualization.
- Reconcile your billing to your customers

## The Job resource

To support your reconciliation workflows, you can use this long-running export API that notifies you via a webhook when the export is completed.

> The exports are generated with each day’s data defined by activity between 12:00 AM UTC and 11:59 PM UTC.

To run an export, you create a job on the Job Resource. When you create the job you can set format, export type, and additional supported export parameters.

The results are available for seven days after the job completes

### Job schema

<JsonSchema
  definitionId="export"
  pointer="#/components/schemas/Job"
  hideSamples={false}
/>

## Working with date and time fields

All date and time fields are formatted defined in [RFC 3339, section 5.6](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339#section-5.6), as defined in [schema.org](https://schema.org/Date).
When DateTime field is a parameter in and it's not complete, we will treat it as the lowest value.

## Examples

```
2020-10-10T15:42:59
2020-10-10 will be treated as 2020-10-10T00:00:00Z
```

All dates and times are in UTC format.

## Authentication

Basic and OAuth Authentication

## Errors

All errors will throw an HTTP error with a description and body with a generic object model to describe errors.

<OpenApiResponse
  definitionId="export"
  pointer="#/components/responses/Error404Response"
  hideSamples={true}
/>

<OpenApiResponse
  definitionId="export"
  pointer="#/components/responses/ErrorResponse"
  hideSamples={true}
/>
