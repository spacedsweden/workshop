Title: Set up Sinch account
---

# Sign up for your free Sinch trial account

1. First, you’ll want to sign up for your no-credit-card-required, [free account](https://www.sinch.com/). It’s simple, free, and we give you credit with which to test.

   Once you sign up, you’ll get an email to verify that it’s you and we’ll need to verify your phone number for security reasons.

2. Now that you’ve signed up, you should see your [Dashboard](https://dashboard.sinch.com/dashboard). Here you’ll find your Sinch credentials, information about usage, how to get a virtual number, test credits and much more.

3. To send and receive SMS messages, you’ll need a Sinch number to send messages. You can choose a number yourself, or you can let Sinch choose one for you. We'll even give you a free test number to use. Go to the Numbers section in the dashboard of your account and click **Activate Your Free Test Number**.
