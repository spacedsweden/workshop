## Kick All Conference Participants

**\[DELETE] /conferences/id/{conferenceId}** - Kicks all participants from an ongoing conference

### Authorization

This is a protected resource and requires an [application signed request](../authentication.md#application-signed-request) or [basic auth](../authentication.md#basic-authorization).

## Conference and Text-To-Speech Callouts

**\[POST] /callouts**

Requests a call to be initiated from the server

### Request

```text
[RequestBody]
    CalloutRequest

[CalloutRequest]
    string - method
    TtsCalloutRequest - ttsCallout
    ConferenceCalloutRequest - conferenceCallout
    CustomCalloutRequest - customCallout
```

### Authorization

This is a protected resource and requires an [application signed request](../authentication.md#application-signed-request) or [basic auth](../authentication.md#basic-authorization).

There are currently three types of callouts that are supported: conference callouts, text-to-speech callouts and custom callouts. The custom callout is the most flexible, but text-to-speech and conferece callouts whereas conference and text-to-speech callouts are more convinient.

### HTTP headers in callout requests

All types of callout requests support specifying custom HTTP headers that will be forwarded to the customer's backend. The HTTP header keys need to start with `X-CB-` (case-insensitive) and have the following limitations:

- The header key must not contain a line-break character;
- The header value must contain only ASCII characters within the range \[0x20; 0x7e];
- The header key length is limited to 32 characters, including the `X-CB-` prefix;
- The header value length is limited to 128 characters;
- The maximum allowed custom header count is 5. If more headers are specified in the request, the Sinch platform will take the first 5 and discard the rest. This won't cause a validation error.

### Conference Callout

With conference callout, the server initiates call to a phone number and when the call is answered, it's connected to a conference room. The same API can be used multiple times to connect multiple phone numbers in the same conference room.

#### Request

```json
[ConferenceCalloutRequest]
    string - cli
    Identity - destination
    string - dtmf
    int - maxDuration
    bool - enableAce
    bool - enableDice
    bool - enablePie
    string - custom
    string - locale
    string - conferenceId
    string - greeting
    string - mohClass
```

**cli** is the number that will be displayed as caller

**destination** identifies the endpoint that should be called.

<table>
    <tr><td><b>type</b></td><td>is a parameter inside the “destination” object. It can be “number” for PSTN endpoints, or “username” for data endpoints (app or web clients).<td></tr>
    <tr><td><b>endpoint</b></td><td>is a parameter inside the “destination” object. It's either the number of a PSTN endpoint, or the username for a data endpoint.</td></tr>
</table>

**dtmf** when the destination picks up, this DTMF tones will be played to the callee. Valid characters in the string are "0"-"9", "#" and "w". A "w" will render a 500 ms pause. Example: "ww1234#w#" will render a 1s pause, the DTMF tones "1", "2", "3", "4" and "#" followed by a 0.5s pause and finally the DTMF tone for "#". This can be used if the callout destination for instance require a conference PIN code or an extension to be entered.

**endpoint** is either the number of a PSTN endpoint, or the username for a data endpoint.

**domain** can be either “pstn” for PSTN endpoint or “mxp” for data (app or web) clients.

**custom** can be used to input custom data.

**locale** is specified with a language code according to ISO 639, a dash and a country code according to ISO 3166-1 alpha-2.

Supported languages / locales:

**greeting** is the text that will be spoken as a greeting.

**conferenceId** shows the Id of the conference to which the participant will be connected.

If **enableAce** is set to true and the application has a callback URL specified, you will receive an ACE callback when the call is answered. When the callback is received, your platform must respond with a svamlet, containing the “connectconf” action in order to add the call to a conference or create the conference if it’s the first call. If it's set to false, no ACE event will be sent to your backend.

_Example ACE response when_ `enableAce` _set to true_

```json
{
  "instructions": [],
  "action": {
    "name": "connectConf",
    "conferenceId": "myConference"
  }
}
```

If **enableDice** is set to true and the application has a callback URL specified, you will receive a DiCE callback when the call is disconnected. If it's set to false, no DiCE event will be sent to your backend.

If **enablePie** is set to true and the application has a callback URL specified, you will receive a PIE callback after a runMenu action, with the information of the action that the user took. If it's set to false, no PIE event will be sent to your backend.

_Example of conference callout_

    "destination": { "type": "number", "endpoint": "46000000001" },
    "domain": "pstn",
    "custom": "customData",
    "locale": "en-US",

### Text-to-speech Callout

With the text-to-speech callout, the server initiates a call to a phone number and plays a synthesized text messages or pre-recorded sound files.

#### Request

```json
[TtsCalloutRequest]
    string - cli
    Identity - destination
    string - dtmf
    string - domain
    string - custom
    string - locale
    string - text
    string - prompts
    bool - enableAce
    bool - enableDice
```

**cli** is the number that will be displayed as caller

**destination** identifies the endpoint that should be called.

<table>
    <tr><td><b>type</b></td><td>is a parameter inside the “destination” object. It can be “number” for PSTN endpoints, or “username” for data endpoints (app or web clients).<td></tr>
    <tr><td><b>endpoint</b></td><td>is a parameter inside the “destination” object. It's either the number of a PSTN endpoint, or the username for a data endpoint.</td></tr>
</table>

**dtmf** when the destination picks up, this DTMF tones will be played to the callee. Valid characters in the string are "0"-"9", "#" and "w". A "w" will render a 500 ms pause. Example: "ww1234#w#" will render a 1s pause, the DTMF tones "1", "2", "3", "4" and "#" followed by a 0.5s pause and finally the DTMF tone for "#". This can be used if the callout destination for instance require a conference PIN code or an extension to be entered.

**domain** can be either “pstn” for PSTN endpoint or “mxp” for data (app or web) clients.

**custom** can be used to input custom data.

If **enableAce** is set to true and the application has a callback URL specified, you will receive an ACE callback when the call is answered. When the callback is received, your platform must respond with a svamlet, typically containing a “playFiles” instruction and a “hangup” action. If it's set to false, no ACE event will be sent to your backend.

_Example ACE response when \`\`enableAce\`\` set to true_

```json
{
  "instructions": [
    {
      "name": "playFiles",
      "ids": ["#tts[hello world]"]
    }
  ],
  "action": {
    "name": "hangup"
  }
}
```

_Example ACE response when \`\`enableAce\`\` set to true_. In this example, the result will be the same as it would with the enableAce set to false - the message specified in the `TtsCalloutRequest` will be played

```json
{
  "instructions": [],
  "action": {
    "name": "continue"
  }
}
```

If **enableDice** is set to true and the application has a callback URL specified, you will receive a DiCE callback when the call is disconnected. If it's set to false, no DiCE event will be sent to your backend.

**locale** specifies the language for the Text-to-speech message. Supported languages:

> \*cmn-CN: Chinese, Mandarin\
> \* da-DK: Danish\
> \* nl-NL: Dutch\
> \* en-AU: English, Australian\
> \* en-GB: English, British\
> \* en-IN: English, Indian\

> \* en-GB-WLS: English, Welsh\
> \* fr-FR: French\
> \* fr-CA: French, Canadian\
> \* hi-IN: Hindi\

> \* es-MX: Spanish, Mexican\
> \* es-US: Spanish, US\
> \* sv-SE: Swedish\
> \* tr-TR: Turkish\
> \* cy-GB: Welsh

**text** is the text that will be spoken in the text-to-speech message. Every applications default maximum characters allowed in text-to-speech is 600 characters. Contact support if you wish this limit to be changed.

**prompts** is an advanced alternative to using “text”. You can then supply a “;”-separated list of prompts. Either prompt can be the name of a pre-recorded file or a text-to-speech string specified as “#tts\[my text]”. To upload and use pre-recorded files, you need to contact Sinch for support. Every applications default maximum characters allowed per 'prompts'-command text-to-speech is 600 characters. Contact support if you wish this limit to be changed.

_Example of text-to-speech callout_

{
  "method": "ttsCallout",
  "ttsCallout": {
    "cli": "46000000000",
    "destination": { "type": "number", "endpoint": "46000000001" },
    "domain": "pstn",
    "custom": "customData",
    "locale": "en-US",
    "prompts": "#tts[Hello, we will now play a pre-recorded file.];myprerecordedfile;#tts[We hope you liked listening to the file.]",
    "enabledice": true
  }
}
```

### Custom Callout

With the custom callout, the server initiates a call from the servers that can be controlled by specifying how the call should progress at each call event.

#### Request

```json
[CustomCalloutRequest]
    string - cli
    Identity - destination
    string - dtmf
    int - maxDuration
    string - ice
    string - ace
    string - pie
    string - dice
```

A server callout generates a number of events. It all starts with the server placing the call which generates an "Incoming Call Event" - **"ICE"**. As a response to the ICE event, the server expects SVML to instruct it to a connect PSTN destination. When (if) the destination picks up, the "Answered Call Event", **ACE**, is generated. As a response to this, the server expects SVML to instruct it how to service the answered callout - this can be reading a message, connecting to a conference or running an IVR menu.

If a menu is played as a response to the ACE event, the result of the menu input generates a "Prompt Input Event", **PIE**. The reponse to this event can be the same as to an ACE event.

When the call is finally disconnected, the server generates a "Disconnected Call Event", **DiCE**.

**\***ICE**\***

Here, you have a few alternatives

- If you use the parameters like in text-to-speech and conference callouts (see below), you don't need to populate the "ice" field

```json
   string - cli
   Identity - destination
   string - dtmf
   int - maxDuration
```

- Specify a URL in the "ice" field. Sinch will generate a callback event an expects SVML that instructs on how to connect the call. As of now, only the action "connectPstn" is allowed in the reply
- Leave the "ice" field empty (and don't specify destination). If you have a callback URL configured for your application, you will generate a callback event to that URL
- The final option is to specify your SVML inline as a (JSON escaped) string.

**\***ACE, PIE, DiCE**\***

For each of these parameters, if you populate them with a URL. The server will generate the corresponding event and send it to that URL. If you leave them blank, the service will instead use the callback URL configured for your application.
Again, the final option is to specify your SVML inline as a (JSON escaped) string.

## Manage Call

**\[PATCH] calling/v1/calls/id/{callId}**
**\[PATCH] calling/v1/calls/id/{callId}/leg/{callLeg}**

This method can be used to manage ongoing, connected calls.

**callId** The ID of the on-going call that will be managed.

**callLeg** Identifier specifying which part of the call will be managed. This option is used only by the `PlayFiles` and `Say` instructions to indicate which channel the sound will be played on. Valid options are `caller`, `callee` or `both`. If not specified, the default value is `caller`.

:::info

The `callLeg` identifier is ignored for calls that are part of a conference and calls initiated using the Callout API.

:::

### Request

    [RequestBody]
        SVAML

    [SVAML]
        Instruction[] - instructions
        Action - action

**Important**: This method can only be used for calls that are originating from or terminating to PSTN or SIP networks.

### Authorization

This is a protected resource and requires an [application signed request](../authentication.md#application-signed-request) or [basic auth](../authentication.md#basic-authorization).

### Managing Ongoing, Connected Calls

For ongoing, connected calls, you can use this endpoint to play messages and/or optionally hang up the call. There are two instructions available to play messages. The _PlayFiles_ instruction can be used to play an IVR message, while the _Say_ instruction can be used to play a text-to-speech message. The message, if specified, is played on the side specified by the `callLeg` identifier. A caller can, for example, hear a message saying the total minutes have expired and that the call will be disconnected.

For more information on playing messages and performing actions on calls see the [Callback API](callback-api.md).

### Managing Parked calls

For a parked call (see [Callback API](callback-api.md) on how to park a call), this endpoint can be used to “unpark” the call. Parked calls can be considered calls where the ICE response has been “postponed”. When unparking a parked call, you simply provide the SVML you normally would have responded with in the ICE response if you had not “postponed” it -see the [Callback API](callback-api.md).
