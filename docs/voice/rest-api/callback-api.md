# Callback API

Control calls from your application backend or by calling the REST API in the Sinch platform... Read more.

## Overview

Controlling a call from your application backend is done by responding to callbacks from the Sinch platform and/or by calling REST APIs in the Sinch platform from your application’s backend. The figure that follows illustrates the lifecycle of a call and shows where both callbacks and REST API calls are located or can be made.

The **Incoming Call Event (ICE)**, is triggered when the Sinch platform receives an incoming call. The event can trigger a REST request to your application backend. Your reply instructs the Sinch platform how to act. The response can include an object written in the **Sinch Voice Application Markup Language (SVAML)** and it can, for instance, instruct Sinch to play a number of IVRs and then connect the call to the PSTN. The **Answered Call Event (ACE)** is triggered when the call is answered and can render an additional REST call to your platform. SVAML instructions can again be provided in the response to the ACE event. Finally, the **Disconnected Call Event (DiCE)** is triggered when the call is disconnected. Between ACE and DiCE, it's legal to call the **ManageCall** REST API which is part of the Calling API, to instruct the call to be hung up and/or to play an Interactive Voice Response (IVR) during the conversation.

## Sinch Voice Application Markup Language (SVAML)

SVAML is a call control markup language developed by Sinch. When your backend receives callback event from the Sinch platform, it can respond with a _SVAML object_ to control the voice call. The SVAML object type is defined like this:

```json
    [SVAML]
        Instruction[] - instructions
        Action - action

    [Instruction]
    {
        string - name
        ... // instruction-specific properties
    }

    [Action]
    {
        string - name
        ... // action-specific properties
    }
```

## Instructions

Instructions allow your application to play a message to participants given a particular locale. For example, if the locale is set to en-US, messages recorded in English are used. Not all callbacks support playing back messages; see the documentation for each callback for more details. The following instructions are currently supported:

### PlayFiles

```json
    {
        "name" : "playFiles",
        "ids" : [ "welcome" ],
        "locale" : "en-US"
    }
```

**playFiles** plays Interactive Voice Response (IVR) files for the supported locale at the Sinch backend. An IVR message is played only on the caller’s side.

**ids** are the ids of the files that will be played out. These can be either a URL or a local file path for media provided by Sinch partners. The provided media files will be played in the order they're specified, without any pauses between playbacks. Check the IVR section for more information.

**locale** is specified with a language code according to ISO 639, a dash and a country code according to ISO 3166-1 alpha-2.

### Say

```json
    {
        "name" : "Say",
        "text" : "Hello, this is a text to speech message",
        "locale" : "en-US"
    }
```

**say** instruction is used to play a text-to-speech message to the end user. The message is provided in the text field.

**text** is a string that contains the message to be played. The default maximum length is 600 characters. To change this limit, please contact support.

**locale** is specified with a language code according to ISO 639, a dash and a country code according to ISO 3166-1 alpha-2.

### SendDtmf

```json
    {
        "name" : "sendDtmf",
        "value" : "1234#"
    }
```

**value** Specifies the DTMF to send to the caller. Valid characters in the string are "0"-"9", "#" and "w". A "w" will render a 500 ms pause. Example: "ww1234#w#" will render a 1s pause, the DTMF tones "1", "2", "3", "4" and "#" followed by a 0.5s pause and finally the DTMF tone for "#".

### SetCookie

```json
    {
        "name" : "SetCookie",
        "key" : "cookiename",
        "value" : "cookievalue"
    }
```

**key** the name of the cookie you want to set.

**value** the value of the cookie you want to set.

If you set a cookie in the response to an event (like “ice” or “ace”), it will be sent along in subsequent events in the session (like for instance “dice”). This can be used to keep simple application state during a call.

Limitations: The total size of cookie data (keys and values) may not exceed 1024 bytes.

### Answer

```json
    {
        "name" : "Answer"
    }
```

Normally, an call is “answered” when a callee picks up a call from a caller (for instance, when the callee picks up when doing a “connectPstn” action for an incoming call, see connectPstn \[connectPstn]. This normally means that the call duration starts “ticking” on the caller’s phone and that sound can flow in both directions.

This is normally handled automatically, but by adding the “answer” instruction, you can force the incoming call to be answered before the call is connected and a callee picks up. For instance, if you add the “answer” instruction in an ICE response with the “connectPstn” action, the caller’s phone will pick up and its call duration will start ticking immediately (and not wait until the callee answers the call).

### StartRecording

Starts recording the call.

```json
    {
        "name": "StartRecording",
        "options": {
        "destination": "s3://my-bucket/",
        "credentials": "AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE:wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY:eu-central-1",
        "notificationEvents": true
      }
    }
```

**options** is a RecordingOptions object that specifies details about the recording. See [RecordingOptions](recording.md#recording-options) for more details.

:::info ️ `StartRecording` with `ConnectMxp` is not supported
Recording calls when using the action `ConnectMxp` is not supported.

:::

### StopRecording

Stops an ogoing recording for the current call.

```json
    {
        "name": "StopRecording"
    }
```

## Actions

Actions allow your Sinch application to control individual calls. The following actions are currently available:

### Hangup

```json
    {
        "name" : "Hangup"
    }
```

**hangup** is the action of either an incoming call event callback or an answered call event callback to hangup the call.

### Continue

```json
    {
        "name" : "Continue"
    }
```

**continue** is the action of an answered call event callback to continue setting up the call.

### ConnectPstn

```json
    {
        "name" : "ConnectPstn",
        "number" : "+461234567890",
        "locale" : "en-US",
        "maxDuration" : 3000,
        "cli" : "private",
        "suppressCallbacks" : false,
        "indications": "se"
    }
```

**ConnectPstn** is the action of an incoming call event. It instructs how the PSTN call will be connected.

**number** is used to override where the PSTN call is connected. If not specified, the extension that the client has called is used.

**locale** is specified with a language code according to ISO 639, a dash and a country code according to ISO 3166-1 alpha-2. If not specified, the default Locale is used (en-US)

**maxDuration** is the max duration for the call in seconds (max 14400 seconds). If the call is still connected at that time, it will be automatically disconnected

**cli** is used to override the CLI of the client - if “private”, the CLI will be hidden. If not specified, the CLI that the client has set is used. In case of a PSTN-originated call, the phone number of the person that initiated the call will be shown as the CLI. To use CLI, your Sinch account must have CLI capabilities enabled.

**suppressCallbacks** if set to true, you are opting out of the callbacks for ACE and DiCE for this call.

**dtmf** when the destination picks up, this DTMF tones will be played to the callee. Valid characters in the string are "0"-"9", "#" and "w". A "w" will render a 500 ms pause. Example: "ww1234#w#" will render a 1s pause, the DTMF tones "1", "2", "3", "4" and "#" followed by a 500 pause and finally the DTMF tone for "#". This can be used if the callout destination for instance require a conference PIN code or an extension to be entered. If there is a calling party, it will hear progress while the DTMF is sent.

**indications** the tone to play while ringing. Available values:

**Notice**: You don't need to set _cli_ or _number_ if the values supplied by the client suffice.

### ConnectMXP

```json
    {
        "name": "connectMXP",
        "destination": {
          "type": "username",
          "endpoint": "johndoe"
        },
        "callHeaders": [
          {"key": "foo", "value": "bar" },
          {"key": "baz", "value": "qux" }
        ]
    }
```

**connectMXP** is the action of an incoming call event. It allows an app-to-app call to connect.

**destination** is an optional parameter that allows you to specify or override the final call destination.

**callHeaders** is an optional parameter that allows you to specify or override call headers that will be provided to the receiving Sinch SDK client (_callee_). See details [here](#call-headers)

:::info Note

If you don’t dial the final destination, example if you call another client and want a PSTN number to be called, then you need to specify the ‘destination’ parameter.

:::

### ConnectConf

```json
    {
        "name" : "ConnectConf",
        "conferenceId" : "myConference",
        "moh" : "ring"
    }
```

**connectConf** is the action of an incoming call event. It allows the incoming call to be connected to a conference.

**conferenceId** is the unique identifier of the conference. It should not exceed 64 characters.

**moh** stands for “music-on-hold”. It's an optional parameter that specifies what the first participant should listen to while he/she is alone in the conference, waiting for other participants to join. It can take one of these pre-defined values:

> - “ring” (progress tone)
> - “music1” (music file)
> - “music2” (music file)
> - “music3” (music file)

If no “music-on-hold” is specified, the user will only hear silence.

### ConnectSIP

```json
    {
        "name": "connectSIP",
        "destination": { "endpoint": "46708000000@sip.foo.com" },
        "maxDuration": 3000,
        "cli": "private",
        "transport": "tls",
        "suppressCallbacks": false
    }
```

**connectSIP** is the action of an incoming call event. It instructs to route a call to your SIP server.

**destination** specifies where to route the SIP call to.

**maxDuration** is the max duration for the call in seconds (max 14400 seconds). If the call is still connected at that time, it will be automatically disconnected.

**cli** is used to override the CLI of the client - if “private”, the CLI will be hidden. If not specified, the CLI that the client has set is used. In case of a PSTN-originated call, the phone number of the person that initiated the call will be shown as the CLI. To use CLI, your Sinch account must have CLI capabilities enabled.

**transport** is an optional paramter to provide SIP transport protocol. Valid options are UDP, TCP or TLS. If left out UDP will be used.

**suppressCallbacks** if set to true, you are opting out of the callbacks for ACE and DiCE for this call

Make sure you allow our IP adresses in your SIP server for reciving this traffic. For more information on whitelisting see our [SIP-trunking documentation](sip-trunking.md)

### RunMenu

With the _runMenu_ action, the user will start listening to an IVR menu. This menu can play pre-recorded or text-to-speech messages, collect DTMF tones and trigger the PIE Callback Event \[PIE] towards your backend, notifying of the actions that the user took.

_Example of runMenu action_

```json
    {
        "name"   : "RunMenu",
        "barge"  : true
        "menus"  :
        [
            {
                "id"         : "main",
                "mainPrompt" : "#tts[Welcome to the main menu. Press 1 for support or 2 to continue.]",
                "options"    :
                [
                    {
                        "dtmf"   : "1",
                        "action" : "return(support)"
                    },
                    {
                        "dtmf"   : "2",
                        "action" : "menu(sub)"
                    }
                ]
            },
            {
                "id"         : "sub",
                "mainPrompt" : "#tts[Welcome to the sub menu. Enter your 4-digit PIN.];#href[http://your.host.com/media_file.mp3]",
                "repeatPrompt" : "#tts[Enter your 4-digit PIN.];http://your.host.com/media_file.mp3",
                "repeats"   : 3,
                "maxDigits" : 4
            }
        ]
    }
```

**runMenu** is a valid response action to an incoming call event (\[ICE]) or answered call event (ACE) \[ACE]. It instructs what menu to play to the user and what actions to take based on the user’s input. It can also be used in combination with the \[ManageCall] API, for conference calls.

**menus** is a list of menus that are available. The menu with “id” : “main” will always play first, otherwise an error will be returned.

**id** is the identifier of a menu. One menu must always have the id “main”.

**mainPrompt** is the main prompt that the user will hear upon entering the menu. The available alternatives are: text-to-speech, pre-recorded messages or a URL reference to an external media file. Multiple prompts are supported - and are used through separation using semi-colons (;). If multiple prompts are used, the prompts will be played in the order they're specified, without any pauses between playbacks. For external media resources, provided by a URL, both using a #href\[…] and directly specifying the URL are supported. Check the IVR section for more information.

**options** show a set of different options that the user can trigger.

**dtmf** indicates a DTMF digit that a user can press.

**action** indicates the action that will be taken if the user presses the pre-defined “dtmf” digit. It can either trigger a \[PIE] Event with the “return” action, or it can navigate to another menu with the “menu” action.

**repeatPrompt** is the prompt that will be repeatedly play to the user if the correct DTMF digit's not pressed. The same rules as the mainPrompt apply.

**repeats** is the number of times that the repeatPrompt will be played.

**maxDigits** is the maximum number of digits that's expected from a user to press. Once these digits are collected, a \[PIE] Event will be triggered containing these digits. The digits are collected when either the maximum number of digits are entered, the user presses “#” or the user waits 5 seconds after the last entered digit.

**barge** "Barging" means that the user can press DTMF while hearing the prompt asking for DTMF input. The DTMF will stop the message playing and accept the input. With barging disabled, the user will have to listen to the full message before being able to reply with DTMF. This behaviour is controlled by setting "barge" parameter to true or false. By default, barging is enabled.

### Voice IVR

**enableVoice=true** indicates that detection of voice responses to IVRs will be active (in addition to DTMF).

IVR Prompt: "Please type or say your pin-code"

The user can now either type the pin-code (for example “55”) on the keypad or say the pin-code ("five, five" or "fifty-five").

Voice IVR is a new service and it's currently in Open Beta phase. In contrast to basic IVR functionality, Voice IVR is a charged feature. Customers will be charged per detection attempt (an attempt is done if “enableVoice” is set to true and the end user chooses to respond using voice instead of typing on the keypad).

Customers must use the “locale” field to select the input language.

"locale" is specified with a language code according to ISO 639, a dash and a country code according to ISO 3166-1 alpha-2.

Supported Languages:
<https://cloud.google.com/speech-to-text/docs/languages>

_Example of runmenu action with enableVoice_

```json
    {
      "name": "runmenu",
      "barge": false,
      "locale": "en-US",
      "mainMenu": "main",
      "enableVoice": true,
      "menus": [
        {
          "id": "main",
          "mainPrompt":
            '#href[https://mydomain.com/file.mp3]',
          "maxDigits": 4,
          "timeoutMills": 2000,
          "maxTimeoutMills": 10000,
        },
      ],
    }
```

**timeoutMills** is used for silence detection, both DTMF and voice input. Default is 5000 milliseconds.

**maxTimeoutMills** limits time for voice input. Default is 20000 milliseconds.

### Park

With the _park_ action, the caller will be “parked” - put into a loop, listening to an IVR (pre-recorded or generated by text to speech).

_Example of park action_

```json
    {
        "name"   :"Park",
        "introPrompt" : "#tts[Welcome]",
        "holdPrompt" : "#tts[Please wait, you are put on hold]",
        "maxDuration" : 180
    }
```

**introPrompt** specifies the prompt that will be played as the first prompt. After that, the **holdPrompt** will be played repeatably until the call is unparked or until **maxDuration** seconds have passed. If the call is unparked, prompts will stop playing immediately. However, if the max duration is reached, the last prompt will be fully played until the call is hung up.

Unparking a call is done by using the [ManageCall API](calling-api.md#manage-call).

Limitation: The maxDuration value can be set to maximum 600 seconds (10 minutes).

### Important Notice

Not all Actions are supported by all events. Each event lists the supported actions.

URLs for the callbacks described in the section that follows are configured in the Sinch dashboard. If no URL is configured, the callback won't be invoked.

## Incoming Call Event Callback (ICE)

When a call reaches the Sinch platform, the system makes a POST request to the specified calling callback URL.

This event, called the “ICE” event, can be triggered by either an incoming data call or an incoming PSTN call. Look here for allowed [instructions](#instructions) and [actions](#actions).

If there is no response to the callback within the timeout period, an error message is played, and the call is disconnected.

### Authorization

You can find more information on callback request signing [here](../authentication.md#callback-request-signing).

### Request

```json
    [RequestBody]
    {
        string - event
        string - callid
        time - timestamp
        int - version
        string - custom
        string - user
        money - userRate
        string - cli
        identity - to
        string - domain
        string - applicationKey
        string - originationType
        CallHeader[] - callHeaders
    }

    [CallHeader]
    {
      string - key
      string - value
    }
```

**event** has the value “ice”

**callId** shows the unique Id assigned to this call

**timestamp** shows the timestamp of the call

**version** shows the current API version

**custom** is a string that can be used to pass custom information related to the call.

**user** shows the user Id that initiated the call

**userRate** contains the rate that will be charged for the call established to the original destination. If the SVAML response specifies another destination, the same rate may not apply. Also see [Money](../authentication.md#money-money) type.

**cli** shows the number that will be displayed to the recipient of the call. By default it's set to “private”. If you want to be able to set your own CLI when making PSTN calls, please contact Sinch support.

**to** is an object containing information on the recipient of the call.

**domain** shows where the call is supposed to be terminated. It can have the following values:

> - “pstn”: If the call should be terminated in the PSTN network
> - “conference”: If the call should be connected to a conference \*.
> - “mxp”: If the call should be connected to a Sinch SDK client.

**applicationKey** is the unique application key. You can find it in the Sinch dashboard, under your app credentials.

**originationType** may have one of the following values:

> - “pstn”: If the incoming call comes from the PSTN network (a local phone number mapped to your application)
> - “mxp”: If the incoming call comes from one of the Sinch SDKs (iOS, Android, Javascript) through data connection.

**duration** is the duration of the current call (in seconds).

:::info Note

There is currently a known issue, which prevents\*domain\*\
to display “conference”, when the call is coming from a SDK client. It will display _pstn_ instead. This will be fixed in a future release. You can still detect that this is a conference call originating a SDK client by looking into the “to” identity, which will look like this:

_example of “to” field for a conference call_

```json
    {
        "type":"conference",
        "endpoint":"myCoolConference"
    }
```

:::

**callHeaders** If the call is initiated by a Sinch SDK Client, call headers will be the headers specified by the _caller_ client. See details [here](#call-headers)

**type** has the value “callingerror”.

**errCode** may have one of the following values:

```text
40001 - Illegal SVAML
50000 - Internal error
```

## Call Headers

_Call Headers_ can be used to pass custom data from a Sinch SDK client to another, or specified in an _ICE_ response to be made available to the receiving client. Further, if _Call Headers_ is specified they will be available in _ICE_ and _DICE_ events.

Example use cases:

- Specify call headers at call initiation in end-user application (via Sinch SDK client) to make them available to _callee_ client.
- Specify call headers in ICE response to make them available to _callee_ client.

### Specifying Call Headers in Sinch SDK Clients (iOS & Android)

If the custom data is available with the initiating client and you want to make it available to the receiving client and in ICE and DICE events, pass call headers when initiating the calls using the following Sinch SDK APIs:

- Android: `CallClient.call(String userId, Map<String,String> headers)`
- iOS: `-[SINCallClient callUserWithId:headers:]`

This will make the call headers available in _ICE_ and _DICE_ events (as `callHeaders`), and on the call objects in the Sinch SDKs (`Call.headers` on Android, `-[SINCall headers]` on iOS).

### Specifying Call Headers in ICE response

You can provide call headers in the ICE response as part of an _action_, example `connectMXP`. This will make the call headers available to the callee client and in the _DICE_ event.

Example of ICE response:

```json
    {
      "action": {
        "name": "connectMXP",
        "callHeaders": [
          {"key": "foo", "value": "bar" },
          {"key": "baz", "value": "qux" }
        ]
      }
    }
```

The maximum size for the value of call headers is 1024 bytes (counted as the UTF-8 encoded size of each header key/value pair).

:::info Important

When call headers are specified in ICE response, they will be made available to callee, but not to caller. I.e. if call headers was specified first by caller client, but then overriden via ICE response, the caller won't be updated of the changed call headers.

:::

### Call Headers and the `custom` Field

**WARNING**: This is a deprecated feature.

The _ICE_ and _DICE_ events have a field named `custom`. If call headers are specified at call initation on SDK client or via ICE response, the call headers will be available in `custom` in a JSON encoded format. example if a call is initiated with headers `{"foo": "x"}` then the value of `custom` will be `"{\"foo\":\"x\"}"`.

Note that call headers are only mapped to `custom` for Sinch SDK client calls and it's considered a legacy feature. It's _strongly recommended_ to use `callHeaders` as specify/override call headers in _ICE_ and _DICE_.

:::info Important

The value type of `custom` is always a _string_ and the JSON-encoded representation of _headers_ will be escaped when the string value is part of the larger ICE event structure. I.e. from the perspective of the structure of the ICE-event, the value of `custom` is just an opaque string.

:::

The maximum size for the value of `custom` is 1024 bytes.
