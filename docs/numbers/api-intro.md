## Introduction

The Numbers API uses [client_id and secret](https://dashboard.sinch.com/settings/access-keys) to authenticate requests. You can view and manage your API keys [here](https://dashboard.sinch.com/settings/access-keys).

Authentication to the API is performed via [HTTP Basic Auth](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication). Use your client_id as the basic auth username and your secret as the password.

```curl --request GET \
 --url 'https://numbers.api.sinch.com/v1alpha1/projects/{projectId}/availableNumbers?regionCode=US' \
 --header 'Accept: application/json' \
 -u {clientId}:{clientSecret}
```

We also support [OAuth](https://developers.sinch.com/reference#active-number) for short lived tokens. To get an OAuth token, you will post your client_id and secret to the Sinch endpoint.

```curl
--url 'https://auth.sinch.com/oauth2/token' -d grant_type=client_credentials --user <client_id>:<client_secret>
```

You then will use the token generated by the above as the bearer in your requests.
