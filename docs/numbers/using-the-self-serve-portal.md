# Working with virtual numbers in your dashboard

View, search and get virtual numbers as well as configure your SMS settings and submit supporting documentation all inside your dashboard.

## View virtual numbers

To see your list of virtual numbers and configure your SMS settings, [log in](https://dashboard.sinch.com/numbers/your-numbers/numbers) to your dashboard. Click any number, scroll to **SMS Configuration**, click **EDIT**, make your changes and click **SAVE**.

## Search and get virtual numbers

Use different criteria to search and get virtual numbers for SMS, Voice or both. All countries where Sinch has numbers in inventory will be marked as **Direct Buy**. All other countries will require you to submit a request to Sinch for manual handling.

### Search virtual numbers

To manually search and get virtual numbers, [log in](https://dashboard.sinch.com/numbers/buy-numbers) to your dashboard. Then, go to Numbers > Get virtual numbers, fill in the required information and click **SEARCH**. Then, click **GET** for the virtual number you want to purchase.

If you want a random number selected, choose your country and just click **SEARCH**.

When you get a virtual number, if supporting documentation is needed, you will see a message in an orange box at the bottom of your form. You won't be able to get a virtual number until supporting documentation is submitted.

## Submit supporting documentation for virtual numbers

You can manage and create regulatory bundles, if needed, which are required to get certain types of virtual numbers in the US and virtual numbers in other countries. To create this bundle, go to **[Supporting Documentation](https://dashboard.sinch.com/numbers/supporting-documentation)**, click **NEW BUNDLE** and fill in the form with the required information. Click **CREATE**. Then, fill in the bundle details and and click **SUBMIT TO REVIEW**.

Often the bundle is approved instantly, but in some cases, a manual approval is needed. If so, you will be notified via Email when the bundle is approved.
