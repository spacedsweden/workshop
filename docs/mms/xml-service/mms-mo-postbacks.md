# Sinch MMS MO Postbacks

An API that notifies when a customer have replied to an MMS message trough the XML API. Read more.

:::info Note

MO MMS functionality is limited to Verizon, Sprint and T-Mobile initially. MO MMS for AT\&T will be supported shortly after commercial launch.

The MMS MO postback API notifies you that a customer has replied to your message, or interacted to one of your keywords.

## MMS MO Information

To receive MMS MO postback you need to work with your Sinch Account Manager to provision with your account. Once the MMS MO postback is enabled you will start receiving postbacks for each MMS MO received on the MMS MO Keyword or Short Code.

## The MMS MO

This postback notifies you when an MMS MO is received.
