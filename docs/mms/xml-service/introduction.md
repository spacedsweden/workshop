# Introduction

Get introduced to the features and capabilities that the Sinch XML API offers. Send and receive rich multimedia content. Read more.

**Some of the key features of XML API are:**

- **Sure Route Mobile Terminated Message:** Customer’s don’t have to
  specify the destination network operator while using the XML API,
  they can just specify the telephone number where the message needs
  to be delivered and Sinch with determine the correct network
  operator for this number.

- **Device Profile:** The device profile, if available, is also
  included along with the delivery receipt and MO MMS message.
  System-wide database of last know device profile per phone number is
  maintained, updated whenever carrier database is queried or delivery
  receipt is received.

- **Fallback SMS:** Fallback SMS is available thorough our XML API, if
  the rich media file size is larger than the device’s maximum file
  size, a fallback SMS will be sent. Also, also if the device doesn't
  support rich media content then a fallback SMS is sent. The customer
  can specify the default message text to be delivered to end users.

- **Transcoding and Content Adaptation:** XML API offers transcoding
  and content adaptation to our customers where adaptation of source
  media is needed to match the destination terminal profile. This
  feature uses device discovery results.

- **Higher Throughput:** Customers using XML API send messages over
  the MM1 connection thus providing higher throughput

- **saveMMS/sendSavedMMS:** XML API allow users to save their MMS from
  XML using the saveMMS API, once the MMS is saved, it can be utilized
  by other functions through the mms-id returned. Users can then call
  sendSavedMMS API to send stored content from a specified account.
  This allows user to send a burst of messages with avoids any latency
  and consumes less bandwidth.
