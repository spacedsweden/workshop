# iOS Miscellaneous Verfication SDK

Find minimum requirements and information about Grand Central Dispatch (GCD) Queues.

## Minimum requirements

iOS 7.0 is the minimum version required for using the Sinch SDK (iOS Deployment Target).

## Grand Central Dispatch (GCD) Queues

By default the `SINSMSVerification` invokes the completion handler blocks on the main thread or main GCD queue. This can be changed by using `-[SINVerification setCompletionQueue:]`.

## Size footprint: SinchVerification.framework file size compared to linked size

The *SinchVerification.framework* bundle includes a fat library containing the architectures *armv7*, *arm64*, *i386* and *x86\_64*. When linking an application target against the *SinchVerification.framework* targeting an iOS device, it will add approximately 3Mb per architecture slice.
