# Using common verification configuration for multiple methods

Using verification parameters (number, reference etc.) for different verification methods.

If your application allows the user to authenticate via various verification methods, it might be more readable to initiate the verification using `VerificationInitData` and `CommonVerificationInitializationParameters`.

## VerificationInitData

`VerificationInitData` is a structure that holds all the parameters that can be passed to a verification configuration object and additionally is a method used to verify the phone number.

```swift
private var initData: VerificationInitData {
    return VerificationInitData(
        usedMethod: VerificationMethodType.sms,
        number: "+123456789",
        custom: "ExampleCustom",
        reference: nil,
        honoursEarlyReject: true,
        acceptedLanguages: [])
}
```

:::info NOTE:

 In case of iOS there are no method specific parameters but the method specific builders have been implemented for future development purposes and same SDK design as in Android.

:::

## CommonVerificationInitializationParameters

Contrary to `VerificationInitData` that holds parameters of configuration objects, `CommonVerificationInitializationParameters` collects `Verification` instance properties and is designed to work together with `VerificationInitData`:

```swift
private var commonConfig: CommonVerificationInitializationParameters {
    return CommonVerificationInitializationParameters(
        globalConfig: self.globalConfig,
        verificationInitData: self.initData,
        initalizationListener: self,
        verificationListener: self
    )
}
```

## Sample

Download the [sample application](https://github.com/sinch/verification-samples/tree/master/iOS-Verification-SDK) and decide which `Verification` object creation suits your needs best.
