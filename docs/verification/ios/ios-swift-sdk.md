# Swift SDK

Verify users with Swift.

The Sinch Verification iOS SDK is available for [Swift](https://developer.apple.com/).

## Example usage

```swift
import SinchVerification;

do {

    let input = "<user input>"

    // Get user's current region by carrier info
    let defaultRegion = DeviceRegion.currentCountryCode()

    let phoneNumber = try PhoneNumberUtil().parse(input, defaultRegion:defaultRegion)
    let phoneNumberE164 = PhoneNumberUtil().format(phoneNumber, format: PhoneNumberFormat.E164)

    let verification = SMSVerification(applicationKey:"<APP KEY>", phoneNumber: phoneNumberInE164)

    verification.initiate { (result: InitiationResult, error: NSError?) -> Void in
        // handle outcome
    }

    let code = "<user input code from SMS>"

    verification.verify(code, completion: { (success: Bool, error:NSError?) -> Void in
        // handle outcome
    })

} catch let error as PhoneNumberParseError {
    // Handle phone number parsing error, i.e. invalid user input.
}
```

## Importing the Sinch Verification Swift SDK

### Import as CocoaPod

If you are using [CocoaPods](http://www.cocoapods.org), add the following to your Podfile:

```objectivec
platform :ios, '8.0'

target '<your target>' do
    use_frameworks!
    pod 'SinchVerification-Swift'
end
```

:::info Note:

The directive `useframeworks!` is necessary to make cocoapods add the framework to '\_Embedded Binaries'

:::

#### Uploading to App Store / iTunes Connect

If you integrate the Sinch SDK via _CocoaPods_, you **must not** check the option "Include bitcode" when uploading the application binary. The reason is because of a [bug in CocoaPods](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/4624). In the upload dialog in Xcode Organizer it should look something like this:
![swift-dont-include-bitcode-upload.png](images/ebf587e-swift-dont-include-bitcode-upload.png)

### Import SinchVerification.framework as _Embedded Binaries_

1. In the Sinch Verification SDK package (SinchVerification-iOS-{VERSION}.tar) there is a _SinchVerification.framework_ bundle in the directory named `swift`:

   ![add-frameworks-package-structure.png](images/2cbde47-add-frameworks-package-structure.png)

2. Add it to the Xcode target build settings section _Embedded Binaries_ (under _General_):

   ![add-frameworks-embedded-binaries.png](images/089382c-add-frameworks-embedded-binaries.png)

3. In the Xcode target build settings, verify that the setting _Runpath Search Paths_ is set to `@executable_path/Frameworks`.

   ![add-frameworks-search-paths.png](images/e0bad42-add-frameworks-search-paths.png)

4. Setup to run `strip-frameworks.sh` as a _"Run Script Phase"_
    Create a new _"Run Script Phase"_ in your application target's _"Build Phases"_ and paste the following snippet:

   ```shell
   bash ${BUILT_PRODUCTS_DIR}/${FRAMEWORKS_FOLDER_PATH}/SinchVerification.framework/strip-frameworks.sh
   ```

   ![swift-run-script-contents.png](images/0f8e419-swift-run-script-contents.png)

(This step is required to work around an App Store / iTunes Connect [bug](http://www.openradar.me/radar?id=6409498411401216))

Make sure that _libc++_, _libz_ and _libicucore_ are linked (See [here](/docs/verification/ios/ios-first-time-setup.md))

   ![link-binary-with-libraries-xcode.png](images/9b2867b-link-binary-with-libraries-xcode.png)

**That's it!** Now the SDK can be imported as follows (from any of your .swift files)

```swift
import SinchVerification
```

:::info Note

This import method requires iOS Deployment Target iOS 8.0 or above.

```Objectc
