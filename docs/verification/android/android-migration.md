# The migration process

In order to migrate from version 1 to 2.\*.\* of the SDK, one needs to change how Verification objects are created:

```java
val verification =
  SinchVerification.createSmsVerification(config, phoneNumberInE164, listener)

//to

val verification = SmsVerificationMethod.Builder()
  .config(/* Method config instance */)
  .initiationListener(/* Initiation listener instance */)
  .verificationListener(/* Verification listener instance */)
  .build()
```

See the [verification process](/docs/verification/android/android-the-verification-process.md) section for more details.

The process is a little more complex than simply copy-paste, as the SDK architecture has changed. The main differences are as follows:

1. Each verification is shipped in a different module, allowing your app to declare permissions required only by the verification methods that are actually used in your code.
2. There are no `createVerification` methods of global SDK object. Each method has its own builder instance following [Fluent Builder Pattern](https://dzone.com/articles/fluent-builder-pattern). There is also a `verification-all` module that can be used to simplify creation of different verification method objects with similar configuration parameters.
3. `Config` object concept passed to each verification has been split to GlobalConfiguration (one for the entire SDK) and method specific configuration instances.
4. Single `VerificationListener` holding callbacks connected with the entire verification flow were divided into method specific `InitiationListener` notifying about the verification request result and the `VerificationListener` which is now responsible only for callbacks connected with second phase of verification (validating the code). Passing both listeners to builder is optional, however, it's recommended.
5. Some helper utility classes such as `PhoneNumberFormattingTextWatcher` were removed starting from API level 21. There are methods with the exact same functionality already built-in to the Android SDK.
