Find minimum requirements and information about ProGuard and encryption export regulations.

## Minimum requirements

Android SDK version 21 is the minimum version required for using the Sinch Verification SDK.

There is no need to add any specific *ProGuard* rules connected with Verification library as each module contains specific `consumer-rules.pro` file that will be automatically consumed by the the client application.

## Encryption export regulations
