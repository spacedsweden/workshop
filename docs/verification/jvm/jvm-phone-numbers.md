How should a phone number (MSISDN) be formatted in E.164?

The phone number should be specified according to the E.164 number formatting (<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E.164>) recommendation and should be prefixed with a `+`. For example, to verify the US phone number 415 555 0101, the phone number should be specified as `+14155550101`. The `+` is the required prefix and the US country code `1` prepended to the local subscriber number.
