# Active Connection

If push notifications are not desired, the alternative is to use _active connection_. Invoke [SinchClient.startListeningOnActiveConnection()](reference\com\sinch\android\rtc\SinchClient.html).

:::info Ô∏è

Listening on the active connection in a background service is not guaranteed started from Android 9. Android OS can stop background services at any moment. Use [managed push functionality](android-cloud-push-notifications.md) to receive incoming calls from the background or when the application is stopped (but not _force stopped_).
