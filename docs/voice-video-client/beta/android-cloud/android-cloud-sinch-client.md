# Sinch Client

The Sinch SDK is a product that makes adding voice and video calling to mobile apps easy. Continue reading this step-by-step guide now.

The _SinchClient_ is the Sinch SDK entry point. it's used to configure the user’s and device’s capabilities, as well as to provide access to feature classes such as the _CallClient_, _AudioController_ and _VideoController_.

## Create the _SinchClient_

Set up the Sinch client, using [SinchClientBuilder](https://sinch.github.io/docs/voice/voice-for-android-cloud/reference/com/sinch/android/rtc/SinchClientBuilder.html):

```java
// Instantiate a SinchClient using the SinchClientBuilder.
android.content.Context context = this.getApplicationContext();
SinchClient sinchClient = Sinch.getSinchClientBuilder();
sinchClient = Sinch.context(context)
                   .applicationKey("<application key>")
                   .environmentHost("ocra.api.sinch.com")
                   .userId("<user id>")
                   .build();
```

- The _Application Key_ is obtained from the [Sinch Developer Dashboard - Apps](https://portal.sinch.com/#/apps).
- The _User ID_ should uniquely identify the user on the particular device.
- (The term _Ocra_ in the hostname `ocra.api.sinch.com` is just the name for the Sinch API that the SDK clients target)

## Specify Capabilities

The [SinchClient](reference\com\sinch\android\rtc\SinchClient.html) can be configured to enable or disable certain functionality. To enable support for _push notifications_, use the method [SinchClient.setSupportManagedPush(true)](reference\com\sinch\android\rtc\SinchClient.html) for additional steps that are required to fully implement support for push notifications.

The following example shows how to set up the client with voice calling enabled.

```java
// Specify the client capabilities.
sinchClient.setSupportManagedPush(true);
```

:::info

If the application is meant to only make outbound calls but not receive incoming calls, the client will be ready to make calls after calling the start method and receiving [SinchClientListener.onClientStarted(...)](reference\com\sinch\android\rtc\SinchClientListener.html) callback.

:::

:::info

If the application is meant to receive incoming calls while not running in foreground, [Push Notifications](android-cloud-push-notifications.md) are required.

:::

## Start the Sinch Client

Before starting the client, add a [SinchClientListener](reference\com\sinch\android\rtc\SinchClientListener.html):

```java
sinchClient.addSinchClientListener(new SinchClientListener() {

    public void onClientStarted(SinchClient client) { }
    public void onClientFailed(SinchClient client, SinchError error) { }
    public void onCredentialsRequired(ClientRegistration clientRegistration) {
      // You have to implement this method, it can't be no-op.
    }
    public void onLogMessage(int level, String area, String message) { }
});

sinchClient.start();
```

When starting the client (`sinchClient.start()`) the client will ask for a token via [SinchClientListener.onCredentialsRequired()](reference\com\sinch\android\rtc\SinchClientListener.html).
See section [Authentication & Authorization](android-cloud-application-authentication.md) for the details.

:::info

All listener callbacks emitted from the Sinch SDK are invoked on the same thread that the call to `SinchClientBuilder.build` is made on. If the invoking thread is _not_ the main-thread, it needs to have an associated `Looper`.

:::

### Authorizing the Client / User

When the _SinchClient_ is started with a given _User ID_ (**mUserId** in the following example) it's required to provide an authorization token to register towards the _Sinch backend_. To authorize a client, implement [SinchClientListener.onCredentialsRequired()](reference\com\sinch\android\rtc\SinchClientListener.html) that's cryptographically signed with the _Application Secret_.

The sample applications included in the Sinch SDK includes a class `JWT` that describes how to create the _JWT_ and sign it with the _Application Secret_.

```java
class MySinchClientListener implements SinchClientListener {

        @Override
        public void onCredentialsRequired(ClientRegistration registrationCallback) {
            String jwt = JWT.create("<application key>", "<application secret>", mUserId);
            registrationCallback.register(jwt);
        }
}
```

See section [Authentication & Authorization](android-cloud-application-authentication.md) for the details.

:::info

When deploying your application to production, don't embed the Application Secret in the application. The example above is only meant to show how to provide a signed JWT to the _SinchClient_. Implement the required functionality on your backend and fetch signed registration token when required.

:::

## Registering the Client / User via UserController API

You can also register a user towards the _Sinch backend_ via [UserController API](android-cloud-user-controller.md). This lightweight component provides a way to register the user without starting the _SinchClient_. You can also register push token for [Managed Push](android-cloud-push-notifications.md) to receive incoming calls even when the application is closed/in background. The _UserController_ uses the very same authentication scheme as the _SinchClient_ based on the signed JWT registration token that you provide in response to _onCredentialsRequired()_ method of [UserRegistrationCallback](reference/com/sinch/android/rtc/UserRegistrationCallback.html). The _UserController_ provides better control over the registration process than the _SinchClient_ by providing callbacks for each step of the registration.

## Lifecycle Management of a _SinchClient_-Instance

We recommend that you initiate the _SinchClient_, start it, but not terminate it, during the lifetime of the running application. That also implies that the _SinchClient_-instance should be _retained_ by the application code. it's best to keep the client instance alive and started unless there are reasons specific to your application.

The _SinchClient_ can of course be completely stopped and also disposed.

:::info

Stopping / disposing of _SinchClient_ won't affect receiving incoming calls if the user was previously registered towards the _Sinch backend_ via [UserController API](android-cloud-user-controller.md). Upon receiving _incoming call_ push notification instantiate and forward the push payload to the new _SinchClient_ instance.

:::

When the app is done using the `SinchClient`, it can be stopped and disposed using [SinchClient.terminateGracefully()](reference\com\sinch\android\rtc\SinchClient.html) is considered invalid.

Example of how to completely dispose the `SinchClient`:

```java
sinchClient.terminateGracefully();
sinchClient = null;
```
