## Push Token Registration via _UserController_ API

> 📘
>
> [UserController](reference/com/sinch/android/rtc/UserController.html) provides a way, independently from the `SinchClient` lifecycle, to register a user for incoming calls via push notifications. You can also use it to unregister push token if receiving of incoming calls is no longer desirable (e.g. on logout, or changing users).

Sinch SDK supports both currently available major Push Notification platforms on Android - [Google's Firebase Cloud Messages](doc:voice-android-cloud-push-notifications#google-fcm-push-notifications) (later `FCM Push`) and [Huawei Mobile Services Push Notifications](doc:voice-android-cloud-push-notifications#huawei-hms-notifications)  (later `Huawei Push` or `HMS Push`).

`UserController` provides a way explicitly register push token and get assurance that the push token is indeed registered, e.g.:

- The application is designed to receive calls only, and thus must register push token with the Sinch backend on the very first start, while it's desirable to terminate `SinchClient` as soon as the registration concludes (e.g. to free resources). In this situation, the application should be notified by a specific callback on the registration result.
- The application detects that FCM/HMS Push token is invalidated and should be refreshed and re-registered with Sinch backend. Here, if `SinchClient` is running, it would take care of re-registering of the push token itself, otherwise the application is responsible for re-registering.

Both situations should be handled using the [UserController](reference\com\sinch\android\rtc\UserController.html), which can be used independently from the _SinchClient_ (i.e., it does not require creating and starting the _SinchClient_).

### Create UserController for the Registration for FCM Push

```java
public UserController getUserController(String userId) {
     return Sinch.getUserControllerBuilder()
                 .context(getApplicationContext())
                 .applicationKey("<application key>")
                 .userId("<user id>")
                 .environmentHost("ocra.api.sinch.com")
                 .build();
}
```

### Create UserController for the Registration for HMS Push

```java
public UserController getUserController(String userId) {
     return Sinch.getUserControllerBuilder()
                 .context(getApplicationContext())
                 .applicationKey("<application key>")
                 .userId("<user id>")
                 .environmentHost("ocra.api.sinch.com")
                 .hms()
                    .deviceToken(hmsDeviceToken)
                    .applicationId(hmsApplicationId)
                    .done()
                 .build();
}
```

The former situation is showcased in _LoginActivity.java_ in _sinch-rtc-sample-push_ and _sinch-rtc-sample-video-push_ sample applications. The activity implements [UserRegistrationCallback](reference\com\sinch\android\rtc\UserRegistrationCallback.html) and [PushTokenRegistrationCallback](reference\com\sinch\android\rtc\PushTokenRegistrationCallback.html) interfaces:

```java
public class LoginActivity extends BaseActivity implements SinchService.StartFailedListener, PushTokenRegistrationCallback, UserRegistrationCallback {

    private void loginClicked() {
        ...
        UserController userController = Sinch.getUserControllerBuilder()
                                             .context(getApplicationContext())
                                             .applicationKey("<application key>")
                                             .userId("<user id>")
                                             .environmentHost("ocra.api.sinch.com")
                                             .build();
        userController.registerUser(this, this);
    }

    @Override
    public void onUserRegistrationFailed(SinchError sinchError) {
        dismissSpinner();
        Toast.makeText(this, "Registration failed!", Toast.LENGTH_LONG).show();
    }

    @Override
    public void onUserRegistered() {
        // Instance is registered, but we'll wait for another callback, assuring that the push token is
        // registered as well, meaning we can receive incoming calls.
    }

    @Override
    public void onPushTokenRegistrationFailed(SinchError sinchError) {
        dismissSpinner();
        Toast.makeText(this, "Push token registration failed - incoming calls can't be received!", Toast.LENGTH_LONG).show();
    }

    @Override
    public void onPushTokenRegistered() {
        dismissSpinner();
        startClientAndOpenPlaceCallActivity();
    }

    @Override
    public void onCredentialsRequired(ClientRegistration clientRegistration) {
        // NOTE: This implementation just emulates what should be an async procedure, with JWT.create() being
        // run on your backend.
        clientRegistration.register(JWT.create(<application key>, <application secret>, mUserId));
    }
}
```

User registration is a two-step process, where the first the step is registering _user_ (after which you can make outgoing calls using the _SinchClient_), and the second is registering the push token for receiving incoming calls via FCM/HMS Push notifications. Each step has correspondent _success_ and _failure_ callbacks, where you are mostly interested in the _tokenRegistered_, After receiving it, you can terminate / close the application and be sure that incoming calls will be received.

The action flow diagram of the _User_ registration via _UserController_ is provided below. _UserController_'s callbacks are highlighted in pale blue.

> ❗️
>
> User Controller requires signed registration token the same way as it is required by the SinchClient for the first time. Provide it via [ClientRegistration.register()](reference\com\sinch\android\rtc\ClientRegistration.html) callback in response to _onCredentialsRequired()_.
> See more information about authentication [here](doc:voice-android-cloud-application-authentication).

When both conditions:

- SinchClient is started (optional, see the note below)
- push token is registered
are met, the authentication process has finished and e.g. UI can advance.

> 📘

> You don't need to start _SinchClient_ if you only want to receive calls.

> 📘

> It is safe to close application right after receiving _tokenRegistered()_ callback - you'll keep receiving incoming calls unless you _force stop_ the application or unregister the push token using _UserController_.

### Push Token Unregistration via _UserController_ API

When you want to _logout_ and stop receiving incoming calls via push, unregister the push token using _UserController_:

```java
    UserController userController = getUserController(<user id>);
    userController.unregisterPushToken();
```
