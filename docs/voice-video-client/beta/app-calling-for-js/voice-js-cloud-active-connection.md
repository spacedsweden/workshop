> Listening on the active connection in a background service is not guaranteed started from Android 9. Android OS can stop background services at any moment. Use [managed push functionality](doc:voice-android-cloud-push-notifications)) to receive incoming calls from the background or when the application is stopped (but not _force stopped_).
