# First Time Setup

Follow this step-by-step guide to set up the Sinch Voice and Video SDK for the first time.

## Register an Application

> 1. Register a Sinch Developer account [here](https://portal.sinch.com/#/signup).
> 2. Setup a new Application using the Dashboard where you can then obtain an _Application Key_ and an _Application Secret_.

## Download - We are now in Closed Beta Phase!

The Sinch Closed BETA SDKs can only be obtained after direct contact with Sinch Voice & Video Team.\
Contact [Sinch support](mailto:support@sinch.com). Please add the phrase _"CLOSED BETA REQUEST"_ on your email subject.

Both _ObjC_ and _Swift_ SDKs are accessible as a part of closed beta program. Once you signup as a Beta customer, you will have access to both versions of our IOS SDKs.

Both SDK's comes with sample apps. Read more about them [here](samples.md)

  - App plays audio (or streams audio/video using AirPlay) (`audio`)
  - App provides Voice over IP services (`voip`)

- _Privacy - Microphone Usage Description_ (`NSMicrophoneUsageDescription`):

  [NSMicrophoneUsageDescription](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/information_property_list/nsmicrophoneusagedescription) describes the reason your app accesses the microphone. When the system prompts the user to allow access, this string is displayed as part of the alert, and it _can't_ be left empty.

In addition to the keys above, if video calling functionality will be enabled and used, add the following to your _Info.plist_:

- _Privacy - Camera Usage Description_ (`NSCameraUsageDescription`):

  [NSCameraUsageDescription](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/information_property_list/nscamerausagedescription) describes the reason that your app accesses the camera.
