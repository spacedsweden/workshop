# Viber Business Messages

Sinch Conversation API Viber Business Messages specific configurations and message transcoding.

## Conversation API Viber Business Messages Support

Viber Business Messages (VIBERBM) supports 3 types of business account: 1way, 2way
and session:

- 1way is an account which can send one-way messages only - the contact can't
  enter a reply from the device
- 2way accounts allow contacts to reply
- session accounts can't initiate the conversation to the contact. Instead,
  the conversation must be started by the contact. Session accounts only support
  text and image messages.

For all types of accounts the phone number is the contact identifier of the
recipient of the business messages (channel recipient identity).

Conversation API supports 1way and 2way Viber BM accounts.

### Channel Configuration

You need a Viber Business service plan in order to integrate with VIBERBM
channel. Your account manager can help you with the creation and configuration
of VIBERBM service plan for your Conversation API **app**. You can request this
through the [Sinch Portal](https://dashboard.sinch.com/convapi/overview).
Just select your **app** and click on "SET UP CHANNEL" beside the Viber Business Messages channel.
You will receive a Viber Business service id which you can then use in the
[Sinch Portal](https://dashboard.sinch.com/convapi/overview) to finish the
Viber Business Messages integration for your Conversation API **app**.
Alternatively you can use the management API to configure your **app** with
`channel_credentials` for VIBERBM channel. The example snippet below
shows the credentials configuration for VIBERBM channel:

```json
{
  "channel_credentials": [
    {
      "channel": "VIBERBM",
      "static_bearer": {
        "claimed_identity": "{{VIBERBM_SERVICE_ID}}"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

You need to replace `{{VIBERBM_SERVICE_ID}}` with your VIBERBM service ID.

Don't forget to create at least one Conversation API webhook which
will trigger POST callbacks to the given URL. You can do that from the
[Sinch Portal](https://dashboard.sinch.com/convapi/overview) or programmatically
using the management API.

#### Rich Message Support

This section provides detailed information about which rich messages are
natively supported by VIBERBM channel and what transcoding is applied in
other cases.

##### Sending Messages

and the VIBERBM rendering on mobile devices.

the **recipient** and **app_id** which are both required when sending a message.
