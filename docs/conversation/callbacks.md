# Conversation API callbacks

Registering webhooks and listening to callbacks from the Sinch Conversation API.

## Webhook Management

The Conversation API delivers contact messages, delivery receipts for app messages and various notifications through callbacks.

API clients can create fine-grained subscriptions for up-to 5 endpoints (webhooks) per conversation API app through the [Sinch Portal](https://dashboard.sinch.com/convapi/apps) or by using the **/webhooks** management endpoint.

Each webhook represents a subscription for events defined by a list of triggers. The events are delivered by the Conversation API to the webhook target URL. The callbacks are signed with the webhook secret if such is provided. The signature can be used to verify the authenticity and integrity of the callbacks.

### Webhook Triggers

Each webhook can subscribe to one or more of the following triggers:

- `MESSAGE_INBOUND` - subscribe to inbound messages from end users on the underlying channels.
- `EVENT_INBOUND` - subscribe to inbound events for example, composing events, from end users on the underlying channels.
- `MESSAGE_DELIVERY` - subscribe to delivery receipts for app message sent to channels.
- `EVENT_DELIVERY` - subscribe to delivery receipts for an event sent to channels.
- `CONVERSATION_START` - subscribe to the conversation started events.
- `CONVERSATION_STOP` - subscribe to conversation stopped events.
- `CONTACT_CREATE` - subscribe to contact created events.
- `CONTACT_DELETE` - subscribe to contact deleted events.
- `CONTACT_MERGE` - subscribe to contact merged events.
- `CAPABILITY` - this trigger is used to receive the results of asynchronous capability checks.
- `OPT_IN` - subscribe to opt-in events.
- `OPT_OUT` - subscribe to opt-out events.
- `UNSUPPORTED` - subscribe to receive channel callbacks that not natively supported by the Conversation API.

The snippet below demonstrates how to create a webhook using the management API. The webhook registers a POST capable endpoint with URL `{{WEBHOOK_URL}}` to receive inbound messages and delivery receipts for app with ID `{{APP_ID}}` and project with ID `{{PROJECT_ID}}`.

```shell Curl
curl -X POST \
'https://eu.conversation.api.sinch.com/v1/projects/{{PROJECT_ID}}/webhooks' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' --header 'Authorization: Bearer {{ACCESS_TOKEN}}' \
-d '{
 "app_id": "{{APP_ID}}",
 "target": "{{WEBHOOK_URL}}",
 "target_type": "HTTP",
 "triggers": ["MESSAGE_DELIVERY", "MESSAGE_INBOUND"]
}'
```

## Validating Callbacks

Conversation API callbacks triggered by a registered **webhook**, with a secret set, will contain the following headers:

| Field                               | Description                                                                                           |
| ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| x-sinch-webhook-signature-timestamp | Timestamp, in UTC, of when the signature was computed                                                 |
| x-sinch-webhook-signature-nonce     | A unique nonce that can be used to protect against reply attacks                                      |
| x-sinch-webhook-signature-algorithm | The HMAC signature algorithm that was used to compute the signature. For now it's set to HmacSHA256.  |
| x-sinch-webhook-signature           | The signature of the raw HTTP body, the timestamp, and the nonce as computed by the Conversation API. |

The receiver of signed callbacks should perform the following steps:

1. Compute the signature using `base64(HMAC(secret, signed_data))` where `signed_data` is UTF-8 encoded dot-separated concatenation of the raw HTTP body, the nonce and the timestamp in that order:

  > raw callback body || . || x-sinch-webhook-signature-nonce || . || x-sinch-webhook-signature-timestamp

  **Note:** Don't disable padding when creating the `base64` encoding of the signature.
2. Compare the computed signature with the one included in the `x-sinch-webhook-signature` header. The callback should be discarded in case of mismatching signatures.
3. Make sure that the timestamp is within an acceptable time window. That is the difference between the current time in UTC and the timestamp in the headers is sufficiently small.
4. Make sure that the nonce is unique by keeping track of previously received nonces.

## Callback Format

Each callback dispatched by Conversation API has a JSON payload with the following top-level properties:

| Field         | Type               | Description                                                                                |
| ------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| project_id    | string             | The project ID of the app which has subscribed for the callback.                           |
| app_id        | string             | Id of the subscribed app.                                                                  |
| accepted_time | ISO 8601 timestamp | Timestamp marking when the channel callback was accepted/received by the Conversation API. |
| event_time    | ISO 8601 timestamp | Timestamp of the event as provided by the underlying channels.                             |

Each specific callback type adds additional properties to the payload which are described in detail in the section below.

##### App-scoped Channel Identities

Currently, Facebook Messenger and Viber Bot channels are using app-scoped channel identities
which means contacts will have different channel identities for different apps. For example, Facebook Messenger uses PSIDs (Page-Scoped IDs) as channel identities. The app_id is pointing to the app linked to the Facebook page for which this PSID is issued.

### Inbound Event

This callback delivers channel events such as _composing_ to the API clients. The message details are given in a top level `event` field. It's a JSON object with the following properties:

    "contact_id": "01EXA07N79THJ20WSN6AS30TMW",
    "metadata": ""
  }
}
```

When the sending of the message failed the receipt includes a reason object describing the error:

```json
{
  "app_id": "01EB37HMH1M6SV18BSNS3G135H",
  "accepted_time": "2020-11-17T16:01:06.374Z",

    },
    "metadata": ""
  }
}
```

#### Delivery Status

The field `status` is included in delivery report callbacks and shows the status of the message or event delivery. The `status` field can have the following values:

- `QUEUED`
- `QUEUED_ON_CHANNEL`
- `DELIVERED`
- `READ`
- `FAILED`
- `SWITCHING_CHANNEL`

Each message and event sent by the API clients to contacts go through the following states:

1. The message is successfully queued in Conversation API. It has status `QUEUED`.
2. The message is successfully dispatched to an underlying channel. It has status `QUEUED_ON_CHANNEL`.
3. A delivery report is sent from the underlying channel detailing the delivery status on the channel. Depending on the channel response and the processing state of the message the message is transitioned to one of following states:

   3.1 `DELIVERED` - the channel delivery report indicated the message has reached the end user. Some channels can later send new delivery report with status `READ`.

   3.2 `READ` - the channel delivery report indicated the message was seen or read by the end user. This is a terminal state. There can't be more state changes after the message is in `READ` state. Some channel will omit sending `DELIVERED` when the message is seen immediately by the user. In such cases the `DELIVERED` status is implicit.

   3.3 `FAILED` - the channel delivery report indicated the message delivery failed and there are no more channels to try according to the channel priority defined in the send request. This is a terminal state. There can't be more state changes after the message is `FAILED` state.

   3.4 `SWITCHING_CHANNEL` - the channel delivery report indicated the message delivery failed. However, there are more channels which Conversation API can try to send the message according to the channel priority defined in the send request.

**Note:** There are no callbacks sent for status `QUEUED` since this state is already known
by the API clients when they receive successful response from the **/messages:send** endpoint.

#### Reason

The `reason` field in `FAILED` or `SWITCHING_CHANNEL` delivery report callbacks provides information for the reason of the failure.

The table below shows the properties of the `reason` field:

| Field       | Type   | Description                                                                                                                                           |
| ----------- | ------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| code        | string | High-level classification of the error. See [Error Codes](/docs/conversation/callbacks.md#error-codes) for details.                                   |
| description | string | A description of the reason.                                                                                                                          |
| sub_code    | string | The sub code is a more detailed classification of the main error. See [Error Sub-Codes](/docs/conversation/callbacks.md#error-sub-codes) for details. |

##### Error Codes

Conversation API provides a set of common reason codes which can be used to automate the error handling by the API clients.
The codes are as follow:

- **_RATE_LIMITED_** - the message or event wasn't sent due to rate limiting.
- **_RECIPIENT_INVALID_CHANNEL_IDENTITY_** - the channel recipient identity was malformed.
- **_RECIPIENT_NOT_REACHABLE_** - it wasn't possible to reach the contact, or channel recipient identity, on the channel.
- **_RECIPIENT_NOT_OPTED_IN_** - the contact, or channel recipient identity, hasn't opted in on the channel.
- **_OUTSIDE_ALLOWED_SENDING_WINDOW_** - the allowed sending window has expired. See the [channel support documentation](/docs/conversation/channel-support.md) for more information about how the sending window works for the different channels.
- **_CHANNEL_FAILURE_** - the channel failed to accept the message. The Conversation API performs multiple retries in case of transient errors.
- **_CHANNEL_BAD_CONFIGURATION_** - the channel configuration of the app is wrong. The bad configuration caused the channel to reject the message.
- **_CHANNEL_CONFIGURATION_MISSING_** - the referenced app has no configuration for the channel.
- **_MEDIA_TYPE_UNSUPPORTED_** - indicates that the sent message had an unsupported media type.
- **_MEDIA_TOO_LARGE_** - some of the referenced media files are too large. Please read the See the [channel support documentation](/docs/conversation/channel-support.md) to find out the limitations on file size that the different channels impose.
- **_MEDIA_NOT_REACHABLE_** - the provided media link wasn't accessible from the Conversation API or from the underlying channels. Please make sure that the media file is accessible.
- **_NO_CHANNELS_LEFT_** - no channels to try to send the message to. This error will occur if all applicable channels have been attempted.
- **_TEMPLATE_NOT_FOUND_** - the referenced template wasn't found.
- **_TEMPLATE_INSUFFICIENT_PARAMETERS_** - not all parameters defined in the template were provided when sending a template message.
- **_TEMPLATE_NON_EXISTING_LANGUAGE_OR_VERSION_** - the selected language, or version, of the referenced template didn't exist. Please check the available versions and languages of the template.
- **_DELIVERY_TIMED_OUT_** - the message or event delivery failed due to a channel-imposed timeout.
- **_DELIVERY_REJECTED_DUE_TO_POLICY_** - the message or event was rejected by the channel due to a policy. Some channels have specific policies that must be met to send a message. See the [channel support documentation](/docs/conversation/channel-support.md) for more information about when this error will be triggered.
- **_CONTACT_NOT_FOUND_** - the provided Contact ID didn't exist.
- **_BAD_REQUEST_** - Conversation API validates send requests in two different stages. The first stage is right before the message is enqueued. If this first validation fails the API responds with 400 Bad Request and the request is discarded immediately. The second validation kicks in during message processing and it normally contains channel specific validation rules. Failures during second request validation are delivered as callbacks to MESSAGE_DELIVERY (EVENT_DELIVERY) webhooks with ReasonCode BAD_REQUEST.
- **_UNKNOWN_APP_** - missing app. This error may occur when the app is removed during message processing.
- **_NO_CHANNEL_IDENTITY_FOR_CONTACT_** - the contact has no channel identities for the resolved channel priorities.
- **_CHANNEL_REJECT_** - generic error for channel permanently rejecting a message.
- **_UNKNOWN_** - returned if no other code can be used to describe the encountered error.
- **_INTERNAL_ERROR_** - an internal error occurred. Please save the entire callback if you want to report an error.

##### Error Sub-Codes

- **_UNSPECIFIED_SUB_CODE_** - used if no other sub code can be used to describe the encountered error.
- **_ATTACHMENT_REJECTED_** - occurs when the message attachment has been rejected by the channel due to a policy. Some channels have specific policies that must be met to receive an attachment.

### Opt Out

This callback is used to deliver opt-out notifications from the channels or the results of
the asynchronous opt-out registrations done through the _/optouts:register_ endpoint.
The opt-out details are given in a top level `opt_out_notification` field with the following properties:

| Field         | Type   | Description                                                                                                                   |
| ------------- | ------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| request_id    | string | ID generated when making an opt-out registration request. Can be used to detect duplicates.                                   |
| contact_id    | string | The ID of the contact which is the subject of the opt-out.                                                                    |
| channel       | string | The channel of the opt-out.                                                                                                   |
| identity      | string | The channel identity example, a phone number for SMS, WhatsApp and Viber Business.                                            |
| status        | string | Status of the opt-out registration. One of `OPT_OUT_SUCCEEDED` or `OPT_OUT_FAILED`.                                           |
| error_details | object | It's set in case of errors. It contains a single string property `description` containing a human-readable error description. |

### Unsupported Callback

Some of the callbacks received from the underlying channels might be specific to a single channel or
may not have a proper mapping in Conversation API yet. In such cases the callbacks are forwarded as is
all the way to the API clients subscribed to the `UNSUPPORTED` webhook trigger.

The source of the unsupported callback is given in a top level `unsupported_callback` field. It's a JSON object with the following properties:

| Field   | Type   | Description                                       |
| ------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| channel | string | The channel which is the source of this callback. |
| payload | string | Normally a JSON payload as sent by the channel.   |
