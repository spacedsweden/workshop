# Front integration sample

[Front](https://frontapp.com/) is a cloud-based customer communication platform that allows you to collaborate, comment, assign and respond to your customer's support needs -- all from the convenience of one inbox regardless of which mobile messaging channels your customers are using.

## Node

These sample applications show you how you can integrate the Front API and Sinch Conversation API to use one custom channel.

## Getting started

1. Clone the repo [Github](https://github.com/sinch/conversation-samples/tree/main/node/front-integrations/)

[Simple text](https://github.com/sinch/conversation-samples/tree/main/node/front-integrations/simpleText) sample will show you how to exchange SMS and FB messenger text-based messages.
[Media messages](https://github.com/sinch/conversation-samples/tree/main/node/front-integrations/richMessaging) will show how how to work with attachments such as images between the two apis.

Each folder has a readme file that will guide you thru the steps to send and receive messages with Front and Sinch.
